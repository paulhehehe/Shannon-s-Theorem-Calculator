In a practical application of the MVC design pattern, I developed a GUI application in Java for calculating Shannon's Theorem as part of CST 8288 Object Oriented Programming. The project involved implementing the 'model' using the provided 'ShannonsTheorem' class, creating the 'view' and 'presenter' components, and utilizing NetBeans IDE for project development. This exercise also required thorough documentation through Javadoc comments, exceptional handling of input errors, and the effective organization of project layout using multiple packages.
